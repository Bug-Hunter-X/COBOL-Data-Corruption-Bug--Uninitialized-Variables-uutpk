01  WS-AREA-1 PIC X(100) VALUE SPACES. 
01  WS-AREA-2 PIC X(100) VALUE SPACES. 
* In the solution, we initialize WS-AREA-1 and WS-AREA-2 to spaces.  
* This ensures that both variables contain predictable values at the beginning of the program. 
* This practice is essential to prevent data corruption or unexpected behavior during program execution.
