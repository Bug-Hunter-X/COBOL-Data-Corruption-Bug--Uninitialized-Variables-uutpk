01  WS-AREA-1 PIC X(100). 
01  WS-AREA-2 PIC X(100). 
* In a COBOL program, if WS-AREA-1 and WS-AREA-2 are defined and used incorrectly, data corruption or unexpected results may occur. For example, if WS-AREA-1 is updated and then WS-AREA-2 is used without being initialized, there may be issues.
* A common error is initializing WS-AREA-1 and WS-AREA-2 only in one specific section of the program and forgetting to initialize them in other parts, leading to unpredictable values or program crashes.
